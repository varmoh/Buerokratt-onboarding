# Bürokratt onboarding

## In case you're just wondering

Bürokratt is an initiative by the [Ministry of Economics Affairs and Communications of Estonia](https://www.mkm.ee/) to, in the end, provide all of the Estonian government e-services (about 3,000 of them), plus potentially any of the private sector ones, via both text-based and voice input.

Technical implementation of Bürokratt is provided by the Department of Machine Learning and Language Technology of [Information System Authority of Estonia](https://www.ria.ee/).

Recording from last Bürokratt Information day (07.08.2024) can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_HXF-Rnuac)



## How we develop Bürokratt

### Open development

Bürokratt is being developed on the basis of open development. You can [read more about it from here](https://medium.com/digiriik/why-b%C3%BCrokratt-chose-the-model-of-open-development-fd20d32a04b). In short - no private repos, no private planning, no private nothing. The code committed by developers ends up straight at public GitHub repos and the moment we see it, everyone else sees it as well.

Everything starts from https://github.com/buerokratt. All of our project can be found from https://github.com/orgs/buerokratt/projects and repos from https://github.com/orgs/buerokratt/repositories.

### Procurements and partners

We switched from relying on a small number of partners **to having a wide range of development partners.** Everyone who wanted to sign up for a procurement had a chance to do it regardless of their size, history, etc. As a result, we currently have 25 partners eligible to participate in our mini-tenders and ca 40+ waiting for the paperwork to be finished so they could join as well.

## If you want to participate as a developer

### Architecture

A high-level overview of Bürokratt architecture can be found at https://koodivaramu.eesti.ee/buerokratt/architecture/buerokratt-high-level.

A couple of flows to look at are [chat flow](https://koodivaramu.eesti.ee/buerokratt/architecture/buerokratt-high-level/-/blob/master/buerokratt_chat_flow.png) and [input processing](https://koodivaramu.eesti.ee/buerokratt/architecture/buerokratt-high-level/-/blob/master/buerokratt_input_processing.png).

### GitHub

#### References

All of Bürokratt's projects can be found from https://github.com/orgs/buerokratt/projects.

All projects have a corresponding repo. To see the full list of them, go to https://github.com/orgs/buerokratt/repositories.

#### Pull requests

All pull requests of Bürokratt can be found from https://github.com/pulls?user=buerokratt

#### Permissions

As a partner, first send us your GitHub account name so we could give you appropriate permissions.

**Project managers** do not have permissions to create, edit or delete project issues or their status. This is done by Bürokratt's core team to prevent unwanted results due to miscommunication, etc.

**Developers** (but also project managers) have a "Triage" permission level. You can [read more about it from here](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization) but in short, this means that you first need to first fork the repo you are / will be working on, and commit your code through pull requests.

#### Commits

We require daily commits. If you're not done yet, use _draft pull requests_ to keep everyone up-to-date with your work. Also, every commit has to be linked with its parent issue - pull requests covering different issues are not allowed.

### Mock-services

We encourage you to first set up the full flow of planned services as mocks by using [Ruuter mocks](https://github.com/buerokratt/Ruuter/blob/main/samples/steps/mock.md) for it.

### Warranty and responsibilities

In most cases, there is at least a 6-, often 12-months warranty period for the custom code provided by partners.

The exception goes for (most of the) services built based on Bükstack components. This means that if, for example, services are built as Ruuter DSLs (YAMLs) but Ruuter itself contains vulnerabilities, the partner only creating DSLs and not developing the core functionality of Ruuter itself is free of such liabilities.

Also, if Bükstack components lack of necessary functionality, both mock and to-be DSLs will be created. Missing core functionality will be provided within another parallel projects and will not be a blocker for the partner creating DSL-based services when handing over their work.

### DSL-based developments

The first thing to understand is that we strongly believe in DSL-based developments. This means that unless you are working with either front-end, language technology or developing our core components themselves, you almost never get to write code in Java or other so-called actual programming languages. Instead, you work with YAML, standard SQL queries as text files, [Handlebars DSL](https://handlebarsjs.com/), etc. To better understand the logic behind it, please [read this article](https://medium.com/digiriik/reasons-behind-b%C3%BCrokratt-giving-less-freedom-to-developers-fc04b0751).

### Key repos and third-party components to focus on when onboarding

#### Ruuter | Bükstack

https://github.com/buerokratt/Ruuter

All of our services are based on Ruuter. Whenever you want to make POST, GET or other requests, it's done via Ruuter. The same goes for if/else statements, creating and using templated services, etc. Ruuter also acts as a reverse proxy to mediate all traffic between any of the components. Go through the [guide](https://github.com/buerokratt/Ruuter/blob/main/samples/GUIDE.md) and definitely create your own [Ruuter-based mock services](https://github.com/buerokratt/Ruuter/blob/main/samples/steps/mock.md) to get the first grip of it.

#### Resql | Bükstack

https://github.com/buerokratt/Resql

Resql is used for all of our [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) requests. Every single database query lies in a separate `.sql` file and is consumable as a REST endpoint. You can take a look at [some of our chatbot-related database queries from here](https://github.com/buerokratt/Buerokratt-Chatbot/tree/main/DSL.Resql).

> PS! Using `UPDATE` and `DELETE` in SQL queries is forbidden throughout all of our projects! Every action must leave a record in a database table.

#### DataMapper | Bükstack

https://github.com/buerokratt/DataMapper

DataMapper (you can also find it under the name of DMapper from here and there) is actually [https://handlebarsjs.com](https://handlebarsjs.com/) wrapped in Java. We will replace it with pure Handlebars on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) soon. We use DataMapper to re-structure JSON outputs according to our needs. See some of our [currently in use DataMapper / Handlebars DSLs from here](https://github.com/buerokratt/Buerokratt-Chatbot/tree/main/DSL.DMapper).

#### TIM | Bükstack

https://github.com/buerokratt/TIM

TIM is an acronym for "[TARA](https://www.ria.ee/en/state-information-system/electronic-identity-eid-and-trust-services/central-authentication-services) Integration Module", making it possible to start using TARA-based authentication by just updating your configuration file. TIM also provides functionality to create and use N number of custom [JWTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token).

#### CVI

https://github.com/buerokratt/cvi

CVI is new to us but will be used a lot from now on. It's a fork of https://github.com/e-gov/cvi - also a very new initiative. Long story short - all of our GUI/front-end re-usable React componentes will end up there and will get committed back to the original project.

#### PostgreSQL

We use PostgreSQL as a relational database. [See here](https://github.com/buerokratt/Third-party-components/tree/main/Postgres) for a quick setup.

#### Liquibase

We use https://www.liquibase.org to manage our database schema changes. Sample on setting up initial databases and running Liquibase can be found from https://github.com/buerokratt/Installation-Guides/blob/main/DB_installation.md, some of the sample Liquibase DSLs from https://github.com/buerokratt/Buerokratt-Chatbot/tree/main/DSL.Liquibase.

#### OpenSearch

[OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) will become more and more important part of our technical stack. Definitely get to know with their [Query DSL](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/query-dsl/index/) to onboard faster.

### Contact 

If you want to contact regarding to Bürokratt's **technical solutions,** contact rainer.turner at ria.ee.

## If you want to participate as a language technologist

> We are still making our first steps regarding to language technology, so give us some time to update this section here.

### Technical stack

#### Rasa

We currently rely a lot on Rasa but will make some changes to it starting from approximately Q3 2023. We'll keep the part of creating rules, stories, etc based on Rasa, but will most likely replace intents recognition with something else. This is mostly because of multi-intent recognition and due to the need to have more flexibility when it comes to intent-based custom actions.
